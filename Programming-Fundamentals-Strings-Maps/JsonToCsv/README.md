[Json-To-Csv](https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/JSON-CSV_Converter) is a single-player **Json-To-Csv-Converter** game. 
You need to **enter a number from 1 to 3** by typing it in **the small box **. When you type the **digit**, you should hit the **Submit** button. After that,
the **JSON** with the same **identification
number** that you've entered in the **small box** will appear in the big box on the **left**. After this **operation**, the **button** will 
change to **Convert to JSON** and when
you **hit** it, it will **convert the JSON to a CSV** variation.
