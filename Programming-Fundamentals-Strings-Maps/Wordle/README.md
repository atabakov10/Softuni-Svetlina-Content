[Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle) is a single-player **word-guessing** game. You need to **find the right word** by typing **random words** until you **guess the right one**. You have **6** tries to guess the **word**

Rules:
- The word will be **exactly 5** symbols.
- If the letter that you type turns <b style='color:green'>green</b>, it means that it is the right letter on the right place.
$\mathcal{color{green}{in \ another \ font}}$
- If the letter turns **yellow**, that means that the **word** contains your **letter**, but you didn't put it on the right place.
